\usage{
batch_eval_cor(
  exprFile,
  batchFile,
  Batch,
  NameString = "",
  discrete.batch = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{exprFile}{File name of tab-delimited .txt file that contains the expression data. In the file, rows
should be genes and columns should be samples.}

\item{batchFile}{Path to the tab-delimited .txt file that contains the batch information.
The first column should be sample names.}

\item{Batch}{The title of the batch for which you want to evaluate and do the
correction. Default = "Batch"}

\item{NameString}{String that will be added in all output filenames. Default=NA.}

\item{discrete.batch}{Logical value indicating whether the samples are already
grouped in discrete batches. If the value is FALSE, contiguous batch information is
clustered into discrete batches. Useful for clustering batch variables that are
contiguous, for example, used reads and useful reads in mClust. Default = TRUE}
}
\description{
Evaluates if the batch effects with a gene expression dataset using linear
regress and if the batch is associated with the data, the data is batch-corrected
using the ComBat Algorithm.

Please set your working directory before you call the function.
The directory should contain the input files.
