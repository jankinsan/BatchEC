Description: The package uses linear regression analysis to see if the batch is
  associated with gene expression data and if the batch is associated, the gene
  expression data is adjusted for batch effects using ComBat (sva package). The
  batch-corrected data is then visualized and compared to the uncorrected data
  using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and k-means clustering.
